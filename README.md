# An Exploration of Wartime Propaganda in Social Media

This is the directory for my Master's Thesis project. Note that because the thesis is a monograph, the code here is not formatted or commented, and is displayed simply to show the broad analysis done. It should not be evaluated along the thesis.
The majority of the analysis can be found in `analysis.py`, and the data can be found in `final_formatted.csv`.
